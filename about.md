After a short andventure in academia that culminated with a gold medal in
Computer Science at the International Conference for Young Scientists in 2016, I
completely diverted my attention towards the software engineering industry.

I started working as a Community Advocate at GitLab with a mission to cultivate
and reshape GitLab's online community. After a year, I wanted to ramp up my
engineering experience so I started working towards transitioning to a developer
role. In January of 2018 I transferred to the CI/CD team as a Junior Developer
where I worked to make sure our CI offering remains the best one on the market.

In May of 2018 I got the the opportunity to manage the Community Advocacy team
at GitLab. I always liked helping others do the best work they can so it was a
no-brainer. As a Community Advocate Manager I built and nurtured a new advocacy
team. After bootstrapping the new team I went back to my biggest passion at work
- engineering software.

Due to a couple of re-organizations and team splits I went through being a:
- Developer on the CI/CD team
- Engineer on the Verify team
- Engineer on the CI team
- Engineer on the Pipeline Execution team
- Engineer on the Pipeline Authoring team

Even though the names of the team and my title changed, the mission stayed the
same. Ensure GitLab's CI offering is the absolute best on the market!

After a couple of years of being an engineer in product development I decided to
try something new so I transitioned to being a Contributor Success Engineer.
The role is a blend of what I did as an engineer and what I did as a community
advocate. It's about empowering other engineers and making their development
journey smooth as well as supporting decision makers in guiding the future of
the contribution journey at GitLab.
