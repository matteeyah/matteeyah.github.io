[Backend Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/)
at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com).

After a quick splurge in academia, and a gold medal in Computer Science at the
International Conference for Young Scientists 2016, I completely refocused my
attention towards the software engineering industry.

I started working as a Community Advocate at GitLab with a mission to cultivate
and reshape GitLab's online community. After a year I wanted to ramp up my
engineering experienced so I worked towards transitioning to a developer role.
In January 2018 I transferred to the CI/CD team as a Junior Developer where I
worked to make sure our CI offering remains the best one on the market.

As luck would have it I got the the opportunity to manage the Community Advocacy
team at GitLab in May 2018. I always liked helping others do the best work they
can so it was a no-brainer.  As a Community Advocate Manager I built and
cultivated a new advocacy team. It turned out pretty well - remember
\#movingtogitlab? After bootstrapping the team I went back to my biggest passion
at work - engineering software. In the meantime we reorganized our backend
roles. I was no longer a Developer but a Backend Engineer on the Verify team.
