at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)

After a quick splurge in academia, and a gold medal in Computer Science at the
International Conference for Young Scientists 2016, I completely refocused my
attention towards the software engineering industry.

I started working as a Community Advocate at GitLab with a mission to cultivate
and reshape GitLab's online community. After a year I wanted to ramp up my
engineering experience so I worked towards transitioning to a developer role.
In January 2018 I transferred to the CI/CD team as a Junior Developer where I
worked to make sure our CI offering remains the best one on the market.

As luck would have it I got the the opportunity to manage the Community Advocacy
team at GitLab in May 2018. I always liked helping others do the best work they
can so it was a no-brainer. As a Community Advocate Manager I built and
cultivated a new advocacy team. It turned out pretty well - remember

After bootstrapping the new team I went back to my biggest passion at work -
engineering software.

Due to a couple of re-organizations and team splits I went through being a:
- Developer on the CI/CD team
- Engineer on the Verify team
- Engineer on the CI team

Even though the names of the team and my title changed, the mission stayed the
same. Ensure GitLab's CI offering is the absolute best on the market!
