After a short andventure in academia, I diverted my attention towards software
engineering. It's worth noting that that adventure in academia culminated in a
gold medal at ICYS 2016. ICYS is the International Conference for Young Scients.
It gathers young scientists and ranks their research papers by impact.

I started working as a Community Advocate at GitLab. The mission was to
cultivate and reshape GitLab's online community. After a year, I wanted to ramp
up my engineering experience. I started working towards transitioning to a
developer role. In January of 2018 I transferred to the CI/CD team as a Junior
Developer. Here I worked to make sure our CI offering remains the best one on
the market.

In May of 2018 I got the the opportunity to manage the Community Advocacy team
at GitLab. I always liked helping others do the best work they can so it was a
no-brainer. As a Community Advocate Manager I built and nurtured a new advocacy
team. After bootstrapping the new team I went back to my biggest passion at work
- engineering software.

Due to a couple of re-organizations and team splits I went through being a:
- Developer on the CI/CD team
- Engineer on the Verify team
- Engineer on the CI team
- Engineer on the Pipeline Execution team
- Engineer on the Pipeline Authoring team

Even though the names of the team and my title changed, the mission stayed the
same. Ensure GitLab's CI offering is the absolute best on the market!

After a couple of years of being an engineer in product development I decided to
try something new. I transitioned to being a Contributor Success Engineer.
The role is a blend of what I did as an engineer and what I did as a community
advocate. It's about empowering other engineers and making their development
journey smooth.

In May 2022 it was finally time for me to leave GitLab. It felt bittersweet.
GitLab instilled in me, amazing work principles that I reference to this day.

I ended up up joining Pennylane. Pennylane is a European fintech startup that's
in the accounting software market. My time there was split between engineering
and people management. I had experience with working with third-party providers
that was useful here. Because of this it was very natural for me to join the
banking integrations team. The goal was to make banking integrations smooth for
all supported banks. This was interesting because it was about delivering
stability for mission critical systems.

I managed a team of 6 people and worked with several adjacent teams. Some of the
things that I worked on was process related. Like setting and implementing
efficient collaboration within the team. Others were about empowering product
managers and engineering managers. A good example is measuring and improving
observability for banking systems stability. The last piece of my daily work was
delivering product improvements.

In September 2022 a dream came true. A colleague from GitLab asked me to work on
an early stage startup he founded. The startup is called OpTonal.

I loved everything about OpTonal, but it came with a catch. The product was
developed by an outsourcing agency. We needed to take ownership of engineering,
so I focused on that. Over time, we moved from using an external agency to
having a team of 7 engineers.

After assuming ownership of engineering, I set out to set a high bar for both
quality and velocity. I built an environment that facilitates enthusiastic and
fast changes. A key part was making everyone feel comfortable with making
frequent and far-reaching changes. It's my personal belief that engineering orgs
operate best when engineers feel safe. Systems and processes should act as
"safety nets" for engineers. They should prevent them from causing any damage,
and in turn creating a sense of safety.

Due to a weird turn of events one of the two OpTonal co-founders left. I stepped
up and "became" a co-founder. A part of stepping up was making strategic
technical decisions. I've "bet the business" on the direction of AI development.
We focused on using publicly available general models instead of developing
custom models. This allowed us to pull ahead of the competition. I prioritized
features that are not made redundant by the rapid advancement of AI.

Another instrumental part of the "OpTonal experience" was "breakneck"
engineering velocity. We set 30 changes / engineer / month as an ambitious goal.
This means that every engineer, on average, deployed changes 30 times per month.
I searched for ways to empower engineers. Allowing them to make decisions, be
autonomous and deliver changes as independently as possible.
