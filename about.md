[Junior Developer](https://about.gitlab.com/roles/engineering/developer/) and [Community Advocate](https://about.gitlab.com/roles/marketing/community-advocate/) at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com).

After a quick splurge in academia, and a gold medal in Computer Science at the International Conference for Young Scientists 2016, I completely refocused my attention towards the software engineering industry.

I started working as a Community Advocate at GitLab with a mission to cultivate and reshape GitLab's online community. After a year I wanted to ramp up my engineering experienced so I worked towards transitioning to a developer role. In January 2018 I transferred to the CI/CD team as a Junior Developer where I work to make sure our CI offering remains the best one on the market.
